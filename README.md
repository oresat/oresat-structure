# OreSat Structure Repository
The OreSat project is being managed by the Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS), an interdisciplinary student-led aerospace project in the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science at Portland State University. PSAS is hundred or so open source space nerds, mostly undergraduates of all majors, some graduate students, a few faculty advisors, and mentors we call "industry advisors".

We're building all of OreSat from scratch. For the record, this is a _terrible_ idea. There are plenty of amazing commercial-off-the-shelf CubeSat kits and components out there. But they're not open source, they're a tad bit expensive, and we're an educational group that likes to DIY it anyway. In this repository, you can find the mechanical models of our subsystems: fly them as is, use them as a reference design, or hack them up to make them better! We look forward to seeing what you do with the OreSat bus.

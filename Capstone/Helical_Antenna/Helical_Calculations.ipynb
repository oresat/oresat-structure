    "#### Tether Analysis\n",
    "I'm assuming that the antenna will be slightly compressed by four tethers arranged around its circumferenced.  Let's do some static force analysis and figure out how much tension we need in order to keep the thing relatively rigid.  Alternatively, let's work backwards and just make the spring as long as we can on the lathe and see what kind of force that yields.  Should we limit ourselves to three tethers in order to increase the tension in each?  How does pinning the tether to each turn affect static analysis?  What do other teams do???\n",
    "#### Manufacturing\n",
    "- making on a lathe\n",
    "- manually measured spring back rates\n",
    "- add graphs and curve fit equations (generate in python?)\n",
    "- both diameter and pitch\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wound Stowage Stress Analysis\n",
    "Let's incorporate the bending stresses caused by winding the spring into a spiral (see *Wound Stowage* in the Helical Design notebook).  If those stresses seem reasonable then we will need to look at compressing to a plane rather than the spring's solid height.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Post-Manufacturing Heat Treatment\n",
    "\"Winding of the spring induces residual stresses through bending, but these are normal to the direction of the torsional working stresses in a coil spring.  Quite frequently in spring manufacture, they are relieved, after winding, by a mild thermal treatment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stress Relaxation\n",
    "Apparently beryllium copper is resistant to stress relaxation.  It looks like most alloys retain 95% of their stress after being compressed for 1000 hours at room temperature.  Shiva will talk to professors for more insight into the problem before we dive into calculating or testing anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refine Values\n",
    "The following values should be updated with specifications from the material supplier:\n",
    "- Modulus of Elasticity\n",
    "- Shear Modulus of Elasticity\n",
    "- Yield Strength\n",
    "- Yield Strength in Torsion\n",
    "- Tensile Strength"
